            Justifying text can mean different things, but here we consider "justification 
            on both sides", or "double justification", where text lines are justified both on the left and on the right. 
            That is, all lines except (usually) the last one have equal width; the method used to achieve that is 
            typically to leave extra space between words as needed. Such justification is very common in books and 
            other printed matter and often regarded as an essential property of quality printÂ­ing. On computer screens, 
            it's more debatable. But before discussing whether we should try to justify text on our Web pages, we'll 
            discuss the how it could be done.

            Sometimes the expression right justify is used to mean what was described above. Perhaps the reason to 
            that is that left justification is taken as self-evident, so "right justification" means justifying to 
            the right too. However, in HTML and CSS specifications, "right justification" 
            (achieved by using align="right" or text-align:right) for text means "ragged left": lines are justified
             on the right only. This is not very common, and should be used for very special effects only
